Rdio Top Ten
============

A Flask app for creating Rdio playlists from top played tracks.

---

Rdio artist pages list their top tracks, but each track must be started separately. This app creates a playlist of those tracks, allowing the user to listen to them all without having to click play for each track. I use this when discovering new artists.
